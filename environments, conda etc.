CURRENT ENVIRONMENTS:
conda info --envs

NEW ENVIRONMENT
To create a new environment where packages are shielded from potential future incompatability. Open Anaconda Prompt.
1. Run 
    conda create -n environment_name
    source activate environment_name
Now there will be a (environment_name) in your command prompt (I named my environment gdal_test): 
   (gdal_test) C:\Users\Janina>
   
2. Install packages
     conda install package_name

3. To simply return to the base environment, it's better to call conda activate with no environment specified,
rather than to try to deactivate. 
    conda activate 

4. Install ipykernel & Add your virtual environment to Jupyter:
    pip install --user ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv

5. To access pip install (not all packages are available using conda) 
    conda install pip 
Now you can use pip install package_name inside your environment

6. To use your environment with all of the packages in Jupyter notebook, you must maske sure that it's runing the right kernel. 
When you launch Jupyter Notebook, don't launch Jupytrer Notebook (Python 3) - where Python 3 is the kernel, 
but instead search on your computer for jupyter notebook, and launch the one that's named "Jupyter Notebook (environment_name)". 
Now all your packages will be available in Jupyter Notebook.

7. You cannot rename an environment, but you can clone it, give it the name you'd like and delete the original environment:
    conda create --name new_name --clone old_name
conda remove --name old_name --all # or its alias: `conda env remove --name old_name`
