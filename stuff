You are at Step 3, and got the following error:

ERROR: (gcloud.compute.instances.create) Could not fetch resource:
- Quota 'GPUS_ALL_REGIONS' exceeded. Limit: 0.0 globally.

You need to start over after Google has confirmed your quota has been increased:
  export IMAGE_FAMILY="pytorch-latest-gpu" # or "pytorch-latest-cpu" for non-GPU instances
  export ZONE="us-west1-b"
  export INSTANCE_NAME="my-fastai-instance"
  export INSTANCE_TYPE="n1-highmem-8" # budget: "n1-highmem-4"
