- Two important types of artifical neuron: the perceptron and the sigmoid neuron
  PERCEPTRON
  -Takes multiple binary inputs and produces ont binary output
  output={0 if ∑jwjxj≤ threshold
         {1 if ∑jwjxj> threshold
  where x is a binary input and w is a weight, so x is 0 or 1 depending on if its weighted sum is less than or greater than some threshold.
  -- Pereceptrons can be thought of as method of weighing evidence to make decisions. 
  We can move the threshold rule to teh oter side of the inequality sign, and call it a bias: wx+b≤0 and wx+b>0. Think of the bias as measuring 
  how easy it is to get the perecptron to output a 1. big bias - high likelihood of 1. Negative bias - hard to "fire"; low likelihood of 1.
